01 Jun 2007; EyeTunes-1.3; Alastair Tse <alastiar@liquidx.net>
   * Changed version to versionString and versionNumber (BACKWARDS INCOMPAT)
     so that version comparisons are much more simple.
   * Fixed header include circular deps that caused many warnings when
     compiling. EyeTunes.h moved to ETEyeTunes.h, and thus EyeTunes.h
     is now just an umbrella header file to include all the EyeTunes
     component.

     playlistWithPersistentIdString:
   * Added version querying method in [EyeTunes version]
   * Removed certain circular includes (thanks to Adny Kim)
   * Updated Copyright notices.
