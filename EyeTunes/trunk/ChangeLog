06 Jul 07; EyeTunes-1.3.3; Alastair Tse <alastair@liquidx.net>
   * Fix persistentID support AGAIN for iTunes 7.3 as they reverted their
     previous changes. Patch thanks to Andy Kim of Potion Factory.

18 Jun 07; EyeTunes-1.3.2; Alastair Tse <alastair@liquidx.net>
   * Set extra headers as "Public" instead of "Project" in XCode
     so they get exported to the Eyetunes.framework when it builds.

03 Jun 2007; EyeTunes-1.3.1; Alastair Tse <alastair@liquidx.net>
   * Removed accidentally left behind debugging string.
   
01 Jun 2007; EyeTunes-1.3; Alastair Tse <alastair@liquidx.net>
   * Changed version to versionString and versionNumber (BACKWARDS INCOMPAT)
     so that version comparisons are much more simple.
   * Fixed header include circular deps that caused many warnings when
     compiling. EyeTunes.h moved to ETEyeTunes.h, and thus EyeTunes.h
     is now just an umbrella header file to include all the EyeTunes
     component.

   * Added persistentIdAsString, trackWithPersistentIdString: and
     playlistWithPersistentIdString:

   * Removed certain circular includes (thanks to Adny Kim)
   * Updated Copyright notices.
